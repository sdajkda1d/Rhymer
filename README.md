# Rhymer
This project primarily aims to extract rhymes from Chinese poetry and provide statistical analysis of these rhymes. This will facilitate poetry enthusiasts' study of commonly used rhymes by ancient poets and writers, supporting their future poetry creation. Future updates will include features related to rhyming in rap lyrics.

该项目主要是为提取中国诗词的韵脚，提供诗词的韵脚相关统计分析，方便诗词爱好者学习古代诗人词人常用的韵脚，为后续个人的诗词创作提供支持。后续会针对说唱歌词的押韵进行功能拓展。
