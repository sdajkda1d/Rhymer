# Rhymer
This project primarily aims to extract rhymes from Chinese poetry and provide statistical analysis of these rhymes. This will facilitate poetry enthusiasts' study of commonly used rhymes by ancient poets and writers, supporting their future poetry creation. Future updates will include features related to rhyming in rap lyrics.
